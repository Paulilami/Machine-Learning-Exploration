# Project: Machine Learning Exploration

Hey, I will show you a personal machine learning project 
with several components exploring data preprocessing, vectorization, data integrity, 
and basic neural network training. 

**Source Files:**

* `data_preprocessing.cpp`: Preprocesses numerical data (validation, normalization, 
optional JSON output).
* `vectorization.cpp`: Vectorizes data points (random projection, TF-IDF weighting).
* `merkletree.cpp`: Constructs Merkle trees (data integrity verification, proof generation).
* `neuralnetwork.cpp`: Defines a basic neural network architecture (activation functions, 
layers, forward propagation).
* `trainer.cpp`: Implements training functionality (mini-batch training, optimizers, regularization).
* `datahandler.cpp`: Defines data structures and functions for data loading (various formats) 
and type inference.

**Note:** This is a personal exploration project by myself as I`m getting deeper into artificial intelligence
and the development of it.
